Texturing and Texture animation: Ruth
I referenced texture.cpp from HW4 to implement the texture pipeline. In order to separate the solid and the transparent blocks, when I make the chunks, I first determine whether the block should be drawn as a transparent block or a solid block. This determines which VBO the block gets pushed into. Then I use a bunch of if-statements to determine whether the face on the block should be drawn or not/pushed in or not.
In order to use the UV coords to color block faces, I chose to overwrite the data in the vec4 that passed color data. So rather than pass a vec2, instead, I am passing a vec4 whose x and y values are UV coords.
To check whether the UV needs to move or not, I have a flag that determines if the x value of the UV coords of this pixel fall within the bounds of a lava or a water texture. To make the UVs move, I decided to offset the x value by a modded value over time. This ensures that when the coords reach the end of the texture, they loop back to the start point to begin sampling again.
