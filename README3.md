Sky: Benjamin Sei
First I changed the Quad definition so it's z coord was further away.

I began by making a sky shader with the vert shader simply setting gl position and the frag shader doing all the heavy lifting. The foundation of the sky is based on raycasting using the vector defined by the player's eye (really the camera) to the projection of a pixel to a plane in the viewing frustum. In the frag shader we know the position of the fragment in pixel space, so we simply need to apply a series of transformations to get the fragment to world space. However, because the goal is to simulate a sky, we want to project the fragment some distance away, this distance defined by the position of an imaginary plane. This works because each slice in the frustum will follow geometric rules of similarity, and a ray drawn from the eye through the screen and into any other slice in the frustum will hit the same fragment. With the position of the projected fragment in world space in hand, we find the direction of the ray by computing a normalized difference between it and the coordinates of the player's eye. To model the sky, I have chosen to convert the ray to spherical coordinates, with phi defined as rotation around the y-axis and theta as the second degree of freedom. Using hard coded values for sunset and dusk colors as well as piecewise functions to return blended/unblended colors. Now onto the sun. The shader is given the direction of the sun. To get the angle between the sun and the player's view, we take the dot product of the ray and the vector of light, then take the arccos of the dot product to get the angle which occupies [0,pi]. We get it to occupy [0,two_pi] and choose to convert to degrees. Since we have the size of the sun defined already by degrees, we simply check if we are within the sun. If we are, we can do one of two things. If we are within the defined size of the sun's core, then we solidly color the sun's color. Othwerise, color will be a linear interpolation of the sunset and sun. If we are not within the sun, then there are three scenarios. If we should draw sunset, then the final color will be sunset. We could also be within the area transitioning from sunset to dusk in which case we linearly interpolate with dusk color. The final case is when we're completely in dusk in which case we draw dusk.

To animate/perturb the sky, I chose to experiment with simplex noise and varying FBM technqiues. One was provided by the sample, the other was found through researching the topic.
Various code samples for noise functions including simplex was found here: https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/670c22f3966e662d2f83
An article discussing FBM as well as interesting warping was found here: https://thebookofshaders.com/13/
Further reading on noise was done in Inigo Quilez's website including this one: http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/warp/warp.htm
